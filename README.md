# PINdemonium
An unpacker for windows executables exploiting the capabilities of PIN.

## Dependencies

* [PIN](http://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-2.14-71313-msvc10-windows.zip)

* [Scylla](https://github.com/NtQuery/Scylla) 

* Visual studio 2010



## Installation

1. Download the linked version of PIN

2. Unzip PIN to the root directory and rename the folder to **pin**

3. Clone this repository

4. Extract the archive in PINdemonium/ScyllaDependencies/diStorm.rar into PINdemonium/Scylla/

5. Extract the archive in PINdemonium/ScyllaDependencies/tinyxml.rar into PINdemonium/Scylla/

6. Extract the archive in PINdemonium/ScyllaDependencies/WTL.rar into PINdemonium/Scylla/

5. Open the file **PinUnpacker.sln** with Visual Studio 2010 ( **NB: The version is mandatory** )

6. Create a folder C:\\pin and copy the folders **PINdemonium\PINdemoniumDependencies** and **PINdemonium\PINdemoniumResults** in **C:\pin\\**

7. Be sure that you are compiling in Release mode 

8. Be sure that all the module inside the project are compiled using the platform toolset v100 ( you can see this with right click on the module -> Properties -> platform toolset field )

9. Compile the solution

10. **Optional** : Create a folder called **PINdemoniumPlugins** in **C:\pin\\**

```

## Usage

1. Run this command from the directory **C:\pin\\**

	```
	pin -t PINdemonium.dll [-flags] -- <path_to_the_exe_to_be_instrumented>s
	```

	**Flags :**
	- **-iwae <number_of_jump_to_dump>** : specify if you want or not to track the inter_write_set analysis dumps and how many jump
		

	- **-poly-patch**: if the binary you are analyzing has some kind of polymorphic behavior this activate the patch in order to avoid pin to execute the wrong trace.


	- **-plugin <name_of_the_plugin>**: specify if you want to call a custom plugin if the IAT-fix fails (more information on in the Plugin system section).

2. Check your result in **C:\pin\PINdemoniumResults\\< current_date_and_time >\\**

## Plugin System
PINdemonium provides a plugin system in order to extend the functionalities of the IAT fixing module.

To write your own plugin you have to:

1. Copy the sample project called **PINdemoniumPluginTemplate** located in **PINdemonium\PINdemoniumPlugins\\**  wherever you want.

2. Change the name of the project with a name of your choice

3. Implement the function **runPlugin**

4. Compile the project

5. Copy the compiled Dll in **C:\pin\PINdemoniumPlugins**

6. Launch PINdemonium with the flag **plugin** active followed by your plugin name (EX : -plugin PINdemoniumStolenAPIPlugin.dll)

Inside the template two helper function are provided:

- **readMemoryFromProcess** : this function reads the memory from the specified process, at the specified address and copies the read bytes into a buffer

- **writeMemoryToProcess** : this function writes the bytes contained inside a specified buffer into the process memory starting from a specified address

## Yara Rules
Every time a dump is taken yara is invoked and the rules contained inside **C:\pin\PINdemoniumDependencies\Yara\yara_rules.yar** are checked. The current rule comes from https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules:
	- rules\evasion_packer : Try to identify antiVM/antiDebug techniques and the presence of a known packer
	- rules\malware: Try to identify the malware family of the unpacked stage
## Config
Config file located at C:\pin\PINdemoniumDependencies\config.json contains variables which allow to set the location of the outputs

## Heap

## Results
Results are located at **C:\pin\PINdemoniumResults\\< current_date_and_time >\\** and contains:
- **report_PINdemonium**: Json file which contains the most important information about the unpacking process;
- **log_PINdemonium.txt**: Log which contains useful debugging information
